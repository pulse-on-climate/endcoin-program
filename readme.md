# What is Endcoin? 
Endcoin starts by building A DePin Satellite receiver network to produce a reading of sea surface temperatures. This acts as a price feed to drive existing DeFi systems towards positive climate impact: A standard rate for the global economy that is owned by the Earth.


Climate disaster will destroy the economy, and much more.


Using satellites and memes we are building a system that solves this problem by treating the health of the earth as a public good funded by a native economic protocol.
